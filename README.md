# MT-Text-Extractor

MT-Text-Extractor converts string (rMessage/msg) files for Capcom's MT Framework 1.0 Engine to plain .txt files.


### Installation

MT-Text-Extractor requires no external dependencies. To compile and run this project, simply open TextExtractor/TextExtractor.sln in Visual Studio, and simply press the "Build" button.


### Use

Simply drag the file to convert onto the compiled executable. An output .txt file with the same name as the input file will be written to the input file's directory. The end of each string is appended with a newline character, and it is recommended that the output file is viewed in a text editor such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text 3.
